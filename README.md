# UrlShortnerAPI

## To Do

Here are some potential improvements and customizations that could be made to the code:

- Authentication and Authorization: Currently, there is no authentication or authorization implemented in the API. Adding authentication and authorization mechanisms can help protect the API from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

- URL Validation: The current implementation only checks if the input URL is a valid absolute URL. However, it is possible to add more sophisticated validation mechanisms to ensure that the URL is safe and does not contain any malicious content.

- Short URL Generation: The current implementation generates a random string of characters to create the short URL. However, there are other techniques for generating short URLs, such as using a base conversion algorithm or a hash function.

- URL Analytics: Adding analytics functionality to the API can provide valuable insights into how the API is being used. This could include tracking the number of times a short URL is accessed, the location of users who access the short URL, and other metrics.

- Caching: Caching can improve the performance of the API by reducing the number of database queries needed to redirect short URLs to their original long URLs. By caching frequently accessed URLs in memory or using a distributed cache, the API can respond more quickly to requests.

- Error Handling: The current implementation only handles a few error cases, such as when an invalid URL is provided or when the short URL does not match any entries in the database. Adding more comprehensive error handling can make the API more robust and user-friendly.

- Unit Testing: To ensure the code is correct and maintainable, it is important to have a comprehensive unit testing suite. This can help catch bugs early on and prevent regressions when making changes to the code.
